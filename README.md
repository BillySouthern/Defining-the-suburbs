Included are three methods which focus on a specific angle of the suburb:
Firstly, the 'non-census designated place' suburb is based on Hall and Lee's (2010) paper which looks at diversity across the suburb.
This methods situates the consolidated metropolitan statistical areas before removing the census designated place and assigned a suburban classification to remaining tracts.  
The code details the example of Pittsburgh, PA.
