## Defining the Suburbs

Accurately conceptualizing space is theoretically and empirically problematic [@fowler2020]. Without a uniform definition of suburbia, quantitative research in the social sciences has relied on indirect census definitions, balancing bounded units of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, and by examining metrics such as the distance from the nearby city center or population density [@cooke2015].

With this in mind, this research focuses on mechanisms which are consistent across the suburban literature. Three definitions are included based on characteristics of age, distance, and administrative delineations and they are inspired by how others have focused the suburban in their research (see Figure 1).[^1]

[^1]: To note, all of these definitions include similarities and differences. While the reliance on the MSA and the CDP means that all definitions situate a similar spatial territory, each definition centers a different characteristic (age, distance, general categorization). It may be that all definitions both capture and overlook some suburban processes, but this work offers a useful starting point in the critical need to build more empirical rigor when studying the suburban.

To explain the definitions further, the *Census-Designated Suburb* disagregate the Metropolitan Statistical Area from the Census Designate Place and defines the remaining tracts as suburban [@hall2010]. This essentially involves removing the inner core from the city. The *Distance-Defined Suburb* further devolve the landscape into an *inner* suburban and *outer* suburban bounded space. This categorizes the tract intersecting with the Census Designated Place as a inner suburb, those tracts beyond this border as outer suburban, and it retains all tracts that intersect with the MSA rather than ending with the border [@cooke2006; @hanlon2008b]. The *Age-Based Suburb* remove the Census Designate Place and then categorize the remaining tracts based on the age of housing development. Within this, *Post-Civil Right Suburbs* had 75% or more of their housing stock built after 1969, while *Pre-Civil Right/Older Suburbs* situate as the remaining tracts following these dissagragations as they are not the central city and they have less than 75% of their housing stock built following 1969 [@anacker2015; @pfeiffer2016].

## Data and Approach

Two five-year American Community Survey datasets (2007-2011 and 2017-2021) are used to build an exploratory data analysis of how these suburban spaces have changed demographically (see Table 1). For further clarity, ACS data retrieval is achieved using the TidyCensus package [@walker2022], along with census tract geometries, and all data wrangling and exploratory analysis is performed within RStudio. The exploratory data analysis maps how the spatial setting has changed, and how demographic and economic characteristics have shifted between 2011 and 2021 for the cities of [Charlotte](https://billysouthern.github.io/defining-the-suburbs/locations.html), [Pittsburgh](https://billysouthern.github.io/defining-the-suburbs/results.html), and [Portland](https://billysouthern.github.io/defining-the-suburbs/Portland.html).
