#Non census-designated place suburbs
#Choices include the consolidated metropolitan statistical areas and census designated places
#The code retains tracts that interact with the CMSA boundary as we are interested in peripheral processes
#Tracts that intersect with the CDP are removed as we are less interested in inner-urban processes

#This definition is inspired by Hall and Lee's (2010) paper which disaggregates the CMSA by CDP
