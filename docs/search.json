This methods situates the consolidated metropolitan statistical areas before removing the census designated place and assigned a suburban classification to remaining tracts.

Huge divergence in form, function, and structure within suburban settings poses challenges in how to meaningfully define what is suburban. This environment is constantly evolving and changing; new suburbs emerge as cities expand outward, while changes to extant suburbs call in to question whether a given location is still suburban. Demographically, suburban populations are becoming more non-white while poverty is consistently increasing across the urban periphery so our understanding of what it means to be suburban is constantly in flux. \nSuburban landscapes exist with a huge divergence of structure and form in residential settlements, commercial activities, and industrial spaces. In Kenneth Jackson (1985) pioneering work, he characterizes the suburban landscape through four key principles: residential density, high homeownership, the location of the residential setting, and a distinctive journey to work time. However, not all peripheral and suburban growth operates with low density, and not all urban inner cities are denser than their suburban neighbors. Beyond this core literature, suburbs have been discussed in hugely different ways, including ethnoburbs (Li 2012), boomburbs (Lang and LeFurgy 2012), technoburbs (Fishman 1989), industrial and manufacturing suburbs (Keil 2013), and inner-ring and outer-ring suburbs (Hanlon 2008).\n\nJackson, Kenneth T. 1985.

This work begins to consider the differences how suburban space is defined by examining three prominent taxonomies in terms of their spatial extent, demographic comparison, and change in both domains over time. The research presented in this website was achieved through two stages of analysis. Firstly, through a review of academic suburban-related literature, several definitions of suburban were selected which forward an alternative spatial delineation of this landscape, with a brief review of this is presented on the methods page. After identifying several suburban typologies, the research develops an exploratory analysis to explore how the sociospatial characteristics of this landscape have changed between 2010 and 2020. The cities of Charlotte, NC, Pittsburgh, PA, and Portland, OR, form the case studies for this research, with each location existing with separate and distinct characteristics throughout the urban and suburban realm."

    "text": "Accurately conceptualizing space is theoretically and empirically problematic (Fowler and Jensen 2020). Without a uniform definition of suburbia, quantitative research in the social sciences has relied on indirect census definitions, balancing bounded units of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, and by examining metrics such as the distance from the nearby city center or population density (T. J. Cooke and Denton 2015).\n\nFowler, Christopher S, and Leif Jensen. 2020. “Bridging the Gap Between Geographic Concept and the Data We Have: The Case of Labor Markets in the USA.” Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space 52 (7): 1395–1414. https://doi.org/10.1177/0308518X20906154.\n\nCooke, Thomas J., and Curtis Denton. 2015. “The Suburbanization of Poverty? An Alternative Perspective.” Urban Geography 36 (2): 300–313. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2014.973224.\nWith this in mind, this research focuses on mechanisms which are consistent across the suburban literature. Three definitions are included based on characteristics of age, distance, and administrative delineations and they are inspired by how others have focused the suburban in their research (see Figure 1).11 To note, all of these definitions include similarities and differences. While the reliance on the MSA and the CDP means that all definitions situate a similar spatial territory, each definition centers a different characteristic (age, distance, general categorization). It may be that all definitions both capture and overlook some suburban processes, but this work offers a useful starting point in the critical need to build more empirical rigor when studying the suburban.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The suburban definitions.\n\n\nTo explain the definitions further, the Census-Designated Suburb disagregate the Metropolitan Statistical Area from the Census Designate Place and defines the remaining tracts as suburban (Hall and Lee 2010). This essentially involves removing the inner core from the city. The Distance-Defined Suburb further devolve the landscape into an inner suburban and outer suburban bounded space. This categorizes the tract intersecting with the Census Designated Place as a inner suburb, those tracts beyond this border as outer suburban, and it retains all tracts that intersect with the MSA rather than ending with the border (T. Cooke and Marchant 2006; Hanlon 2008). The Age-Based Suburb remove the Census Designate Place and then categorize the remaining tracts based on the age of housing development. Within this, Post-Civil Right Suburbs had 75% or more of their housing stock built after 1969, while Pre-Civil Right/Older Suburbs situate as the remaining tracts following these dissagragations as they are not the central city and they have less than 75% of their housing stock built following 1969 (Anacker 2015; Pfeiffer 2016).\n\nHall, Matthew, and Barrett Lee. 2010. “How Diverse Are US Suburbs?” Urban Studies 47 (1): 3–28. https://doi.org/10.1177/0042098009346862.\n\nCooke, Thomas, and Sarah Marchant. 2006. “The Changing Intrametropolitan Location of High-Poverty Neighbourhoods in the US, 1990-2000.” Urban Studies 43 (11): 1971–89. https://doi.org/10.1080/00420980600897818.\n\nHanlon, Bernadette. 2008. “The Decline of Older, Inner Suburbs in Metropolitan America.” Housing Policy Debate 19 (3): 423–56. https://doi.org/10.1080/10511482.2008.9521642.\n\nAnacker, Katrin B. 2015. “Analyzing Census Tract Foreclosure Risk Rates in Mature and Developing Suburbs in the United States.” Urban Geography 36 (8): 1221–40. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2015.1055931.\n\nPfeiffer, Deirdre. 2016. “Racial Equity in the Post-Civil Rights Suburbs?
