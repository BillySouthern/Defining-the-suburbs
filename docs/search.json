Detailed here are several ways to define the suburban envrionment, and the code can be edited to adopt those defintiions to alternative locations ready for quantitative analysis.\nThree types of suburb are included with all focusing on a specific angle of the suburb: Firstly, the ‘non-census designated place’ suburb is based on Hall and Lee’s (2010) paper which looks at diversity across the suburbs. This methods situates the consolidated metropolitan statistical areas before removing the census designated place and assigned a suburban classification to remaining tracts. The code details the example of Pittsburgh, PA.\nMore to follow.\nReferences\nHall, M., & Lee, B. (2010). How Diverse Are US Suburbs?
